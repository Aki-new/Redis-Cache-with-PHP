# Contributions and suggestions welcome

Thank you for visiting this project. I am developing this class as part of my professional and academic growth, and I am very interested in receiving suggestions that help improve its design, functionality, and documentation.

## What can you contribute?

- Ideas for new methods such as delete(), ttl(), flushAll(), among others.
- Suggestions on best practices in PHP and Redis.
- Corrections to the documentation or code structure.
- Examples of use in various contexts.

## Personal future plans for this project:

- Convert this class into an installable package via Composer.
- Full CRUD and other features.
- Integrate custom exceptions to improve error handling.
- Implement it in other systems.

If you have something to contribute, you can open an issue, leave a comment, or create a pull request. All help is welcome!
